    It's ok to fine-tune parts of registration later e.g. changing the exact number of nights you'll be staying, contact <a href="mailto:csse-teacher-events@canterbury.ac.nz">csse-teacher-events@canterbury.ac.nz</a> if you need to change your registration.
  </p>

  <h4>Payment</h4>

  <p>
    For those paying to attend programming workshops, we will send an invoice to you in mid-November. Note that there is no refund and/or subsidy if you are unable to attend and do not inform us. If you do let us know about cancelling before the event, we will refund your ticket where possible (however admin fees still apply). See the Terms and Conditions on the registration form for more details.
  </p>

  <h2 id="subsidy">Subsidy Levels</h2>

  <p>Our sponsors provide enough money to provide travel and accommodation subsidies to those travelling long distances from within New Zealand. In our registration form, you can choose one of the following subsidy levels:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>I live near (less than 50km) Christchurch, so am not eligible for any subsidy or accommodation.</li>
    <li>I live within driving/bus distance (about 50 to 200km) from Christchurch, so would like to apply for accommodation.</li>
    <li>I would fly to the event from a main airport (Auckland, Wellington, Dunedin) and would like to apply for a $150 travel subsidy and accommodation subsidy.</li>
    <li>I live more than 60 minutes from a major airport and/or plan to drive a larger distance, and would like to apply for a larger travel subsidy and accommodation. The amount subsidised is provided on a case by case basis.</li>
    <li>I wish to attend a programming workshop but not the main workshops so I am not eligible for a transport subsidy. Accommodation for programming workshops is part of the ticket cost.</li>
    <li>I am a workshop leader so I am not eligible for a transport subsidy.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For those who are applicable for an accommodation subsidy, the full cost is covered (including breakfast).</p>
